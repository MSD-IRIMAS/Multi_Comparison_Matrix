## Summary

This repo is a long term used benchmark method that generates a Multi-Comparison Matrix where the user ca choose whether to include a full pairwise multi-comparate comparison or to choose which ones to be included or excluded in the rows and columns of the matrix.

## Input Format

The input format is in a ```.csv``` file containing the statistics of each classifiers as the format of [this example](https://github.com/MSD-IRIMAS/Multi_Pairwise_Comparison/blob/main/results_example.csv).

## Usage of Code - Plot the MCM

In order for the user to plot the MCM, first thing is to load the ```.csv``` file into a ```pandas``` dataframe and feed it to the ```compare``` function. The user should specify the ```pdf_savename```, ```png_savename```, ```csv_savename``` or ```tex_savename``` parameter in order to save the output figure in ```pdf```, ```png```, ```csv``` or ```tex``` formats respecively.

## Examples

Generating the MCM on the [following example](https://github.com/MSD-IRIMAS/Multi_Pairwise_Comparison/blob/main/results_example.csv) produces the following. To generate the following figure, the user follows this simple code:

```
import pandas as pd
from multi_comp_matrix import MCM

df_results = pd.read_csv('path/to/csv')

output_dir = '/output/directory/desired'

MCM.compare(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        df_results=df_results,
        pdf_savename="heatmap",
        png_savename="heatmap",
    )
```

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="heatmap.png" alt="heatmap-example"/>
</p>

Generating the MCM on the [following example](https://github.com/MSD-IRIMAS/Multi_Pairwise_Comparison/blob/main/results_example.csv) by excluding ```clf1``` and ```clf3``` from the columns.

```
import pandas as pd
from multi_comp_matrix import MCM

df_results = pd.read_csv('path/to/csv')

output_dir = '/output/directory/desired'

MCM.compare(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        df_results=df_results,
        excluded_col_comparates=['clf1','clf3'],
        png_savename='heatline_vertical',
        tex_savename='heatline_vertical',
        include_ProbaWinTieLoss=True
    )
```

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="heatline_vertical.png" alt="heatline-vertical-example"/>
</p>

and by excluding them in the rows.

```
import pandas as pd
from multi_comp_matrix import MCM

df_results = pd.read_csv('path/to/csv')

output_dir = '/output/directory/desired'

MCM.compare(
        output_dir=output_dir,
        df_results=df_results,
        excluded_row_comparates=['clf1','clf3'],
        png_savename='heatline_horizontal',
        csv_savename='heatline_horizontal',
    )
```

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="heatline_horizontal.png" alt="heatline-horizontal-example"/>
</p>

## Requirements

The following python packages are required for the usage of the module:

1. ```numpy==1.24.4```
2. ```pandas==2.0.3```
3. ```matplotlib==3.7.4```
4. ```scipy==1.10.0```
